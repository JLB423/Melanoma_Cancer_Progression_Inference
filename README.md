# Melanoma_Cancer_Progression_Inference
To predict the path of cancer progression by identifying specific mutations or mutational patterns that drive cancer progression

Here I am using the Tronco library CAPRI package (Cancer Progression Inference) to predict the path of Melanoma cancer progression, which is part of the Bioconductor library for R. 

Data: Clinical Cutaneous Melanoma cross-sectional patient data from TCGA - obtained directly from Genomic Data Commons portal (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/)

Selected a short list of driver mutations from literature review and from cbioportal analysis of the data; however, this list can be modified/ updated.
